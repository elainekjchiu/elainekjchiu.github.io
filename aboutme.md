### My Backgroud  
My name is Elaine Chiu, and I am currently a Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. After obtaining my Bachelor's degree in economics with a minor in political science from National Taiwan University., I came to the U.S.A. for my master's in statistics at the University of Washington. I also enjoyed the cherry blossom there.

I am curious to see how statistics can push the boundary of knowledge. To see more details about my background, you can check my [cv](https://github.com/elainekjchiu/elainekjchiu.github.io/blob/master/Elaine_work_CV1.pdf).  

### My Interests in Statistics  
I am mostly fascinated by the versatile nature of Bayesian modeling and now learning causal inference. My interests in statistics and causal inference stem from the research projects I did in my college years. The first project I did applied linear regression to study the honeymoon effect under presidential and semi-presidential systems. The second project I did then involved utilizing statistical techniques to identify the impact of the unemployment rate, family size, and demographic structure on the suicide rates of cities. Going further in my statistics journey, I realized that we need more statistical tools to establish causation and estimation under small sample size settings. My focus of future research is then Bayesian and causal inference.  

### My Culture and Hobbies
I was born in Taiwan, a place with wonderful people and tasty food. I enjoy cooking during my leisure time. I believe tasting food is one of the best ways to learn someone's culture. Furthermore, being able to make food empowers us to take care of our health. Here are some dishes I made!
