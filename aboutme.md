### My Backgroud  
My name is Elaine Chiu, and I am a Ph.D. student in statistics at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. I have a Bachelor's degree in economics with a minor in political science. I also took several mathematics and computer science classes during my college years.  As a result, I am curious to see how statistics can push the boundary of knowledge. To see more details about my background, you can check my [cv](https://github.com/elainekjchiu/elainekjchiu.github.io/blob/master/Elaine_work_CV1.pdf).  

### My interests in statistics  
I am mostly fascinated by the versatile nature of Bayesian modeling and now learning causal inference.  

### My Culture and hobbies
I was born in Taiwan, a place with wonderful people and tasty food. I enjoy cooking and reading during my leisure time.
